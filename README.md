# Kindle My Clippings.txt Viewer

A simple, static web tool to parse, clean, and beautifully display your Kindle "My Clippings.txt" file.

This tool is 100% private. Since it's a static site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), your file is processed entirely within your browser. **No data is ever uploaded to any server.**

## Features

* **Clean & Parse:** Reads your `My Clippings.txt` file.
* **De-duplicates:** Intelligently removes duplicate highlights that Kindle creates when you edit a highlight (keeps the longest, most recent version).
* **Markdown Export:** Generates clean Markdown output for you to copy into your personal notes (Obsidian, Notion, etc.).
